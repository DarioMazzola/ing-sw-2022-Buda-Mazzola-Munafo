**Eriantys** Board Game is the final test of the **"Software Engineering"** course of **"Computer Science Engineering"**, held at Politecnico di Milano (2021/2022).

**Teacher**: Pierluigi San Pietro

## Project specification 

The project consists in the implementation of the board game **"Eriantys"** by **Cranio Creations**. The game is implemented in Java, following the MVC pattern, as a distributed system composed of a single server and multiple clients (one for each player). The network connection is handled by using sockets.

The game can be played both by command line interface (CLI) and graphic user interface (GUI).

## Compiling 

After installing and downloading required software, clone this repo by either downloading the .zip and extract it, or using git clone.

Open a terminal, navigate to the folder and compile sources of the package by typing:

```
cd /path/to/project/home/directory
mvn clean package
```

A new folder called "target" will be created in the project home directory, inside it you will find the following jar files:

- `Eriantys-client.jar`: launches the client (CLI or GUI can be chosen)
- `Eriantys-server.jar`: launches the server

### Jar

Precompiled Jars can be found at the following link: [Jar]()

## Execution

This project requires Java 11 or higher to be correctly executed.

### Eriantys client

For a better user experience, we suggest using a macOS/Linux terminal. If run with a Windows terminal, the CLI version of the client cloud not correctly render all characters. 

To launch Eriantys client enter the following command by opening a terminal in the "target" directory:

```
java -jar Eriantys-client.jar
```

Then chose whether to play with CLI or GUI by entering 1 or 2

### Eriantys server

To launch Eriantys server enter the following command by opening a terminal in the "target" directory:

```
java -jar Eriantys-server.jar
```
